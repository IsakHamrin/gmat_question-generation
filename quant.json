        "answer":"C",
        "solution":"Since there are 50 odd and 50 even balls in the box, the probability of selecting an odd ball at random is ​50 over 100 equals one half​; the probability of selecting an even ball is the same.

For the sum of the three numbers on the selected balls to be odd, either 1) the numbers must all be odd, or 2) exactly one of the numbers must be odd and the other two numbers must be even, which can occur in one of the three ways listed below.

1) Probability of selecting odd, odd, odd = ​one half times one half times one half equals one eighth​

2) Probability of selecting odd, even, even = ​one half times one half times one half equals one eighth​

Probability of selecting even, odd, even = ​one half times one half times one half equals one eighth​

Probability of selecting even, even, odd = ​one half times one half times one half equals one eighth​

Adding all four probabilities gives ​4 times one eighth equals one half​ as the probability that the sum of the three numbers will be odd.

The correct answer is C"

If the units digit is 3, then a + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4. This makes the units digit of (a + 1)2 the units digit of 42, which is 6.

If, however, the units digit is 7, then a + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8. This makes the units digit of (a + 1)2 the units digit of 82, which is 4, as is needed in this problem. Therefore, the units digit of a must be 7.

Thus, the units digit of a + 2 is 9. This makes the units digit of (a + 2)2 the units digit of 92, which is 1.

The correct answer is A."
