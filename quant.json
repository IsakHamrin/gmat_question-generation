The fund is distributed among four categories: stocks, bonds, mutual fund, and government certificate.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the total fraction invested\nFirst, calculate what fraction of the fund is in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds by adding the fractions. The least common denominator (LCD) for 2, 4, and 5 is 20.\n$$\\text{Fraction Invested} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5}$$\n$$\\text{Fraction Invested} = \\frac{10}{20} + \\frac{5}{20} + \\frac{4}{20} = \\frac{19}{20}$$\n\n### Step 2: Determine the remaining fraction\nThe remainder of the fund is in the government certificate. The fraction of the fund in the government certificate is the whole fund (1) minus the fraction invested:\n$$\\text{Remaining Fraction} = 1 - \\frac{19}{20} = \\frac{20}{20} - \\frac{19}{20} = \\frac{1}{20}$$\n\n### Step 3: Solve for the total fund amount ($F$)\nWe are given that the remaining amount ($\frac{1}{20}$ of the total fund) is $10,000.\n$$\\frac{1}{20} F = 10,000$$\n\nTo solve for $F$, multiply both sides by 20:\n$$F = 10,000 \\times 20$$\n$$F = 200,000$$\n\nThe total amount of the trust fund was $200,000.\n\nThe correct answer is C."
