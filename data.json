The rules establish that the set of households with two or more dogs is a subset of $C$, and $C$ is a subset of $R$. We need to find the value of $R$.\n\n### Analysis of Statement (1)\n(1) 18 households in the complex have two or more dogs.\n\nSince all households with two or more dogs must also have a cat (Rule 1), the number of households with cats is at least 18 ($C \\ge 18$). Since all households with a cat must also have a pet rodent (Rule 2), the number of households with rodents is also at least 18 ($R \\ge 18$).\n\nHowever, households can have a rodent without having a cat (e.g., rodent only), or they can have a cat without having two or more dogs (e.g., cat with one dog or no dogs). The number of households with rodents could be 18, 19, 20, or up to 210.\n\n**Statement (1) ALONE is NOT sufficient.**\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Statement (2)\n(2) 90 percent of households in the complex that have a pet rodent have at least one cat.\n\nThis establishes a ratio between the two unknown quantities:\n$$C = 0.90 \\times R$$ \n\nSince we have one equation with two unknown variables ($C$ and $R$), we cannot solve for a unique value of $R$.\n\n**Statement (2) ALONE is NOT sufficient.**\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER\nFrom (1), we know that $C \\ge 18$.\nFrom (2), we know that $R = \\frac{C}{0.90}$.\n\nSubstitute the minimum value of $C$ into the equation from (2):\n$$R = \\frac{C}{0.90} \\ge \\frac{18}{0.90}$$ \n$$R \\ge 20$$\n\nThis gives us a lower bound ($R \\ge 20$). However, $C$ can be any number greater than 18 that is a multiple of 9 (e.g., 27, 36, etc.) to ensure $R$ is an integer.\n\n* If $C = 18$, then $R = \\frac{18}{0.90} = 20$.\n* If $C = 27$ (which is consistent with $C \\ge 18$), then $R = \\frac{27}{0.90} = 30$.\n\nSince the number of households with a pet rodent ($R$) can be 20, 30, or any other value consistent with $C \\ge 18$, the exact number cannot be determined.\n\n**Statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are NOT sufficient.**\n\n---\n\nThe correct answer is E."

For example:\n* If $p = 5.00$ and $h = 0.833...$, then $p + h$ is around 5.83. (Note: $2(5.00) + 3(0.833...) \\approx 10.00 + 2.50 = 12.50$)\n* If $p = 1.00$ and $h = 3.50$, then $p + h = 4.50$.\n\nSince $p+h$ can be different, the combined statements are not sufficient.\n\n**Statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are NOT sufficient.**\n\n---\n\nThe correct answer is E."

        "solution":"Let $C_{spending}$ be the spending on cell phone imports, and $T_{spending}$ be the total spending on finished electronic goods (FEG). The goal is to find the country with the maximum $C_{spending}$.\n\n### Analysis of Statement (1)\n(1) For each of the two countries with the highest spending on imports of finished electronic goods (Q and T), spending on cell phone imports was more than 10 percent of that country's total spending on imports of finished electronic goods.\n\n* **Country Q:** $C_Q > 0.10 \\times 120 = 12$ billion dollars.\n* **Country T:** $C_T > 0.10 \\times 100 = 10$ billion dollars.\n\nThe spending on cell phone imports for countries P, R, and S is unknown. It is possible, for instance, that P spent 15 billion dollars on cell phones, which would be the highest. We also do not know which of Q or T spent more. \n\n**Statement (1) ALONE is NOT sufficient.**\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Statement (2)\n(2) For each of the three countries with the lowest spending on imports of finished electronic goods (P, R, and S), spending on cell phone imports was less than 5 percent of that country's total spending on imports of finished electronic goods.\n\n* **Country P:** $C_P < 0.05 \\times 90 = 4.5$ billion dollars.\n* **Country R:** $C_R < 0.05 \\times 50 = 2.5$ billion dollars.\n* **Country S:** $C_S < 0.05 \\times 40 = 2.0$ billion dollars.\n\nThe spending on cell phone imports for countries Q and T is unknown. It is possible that $C_Q$ is 20 billion dollars and $C_T$ is 15 billion dollars, in which case Q spent the most. It is also possible that $C_Q$ is 10 billion dollars and $C_T$ is 15 billion dollars, in which case T spent the most.\n\n**Statement (2) ALONE is NOT sufficient.**\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER\nFrom the combined statements:\n\n* Maximum $C_{P, R, S} < 4.5$ billion dollars.\n* Minimum $C_Q > 12$ billion dollars.\n* Minimum $C_T > 10$ billion dollars.\n\nSince the minimum spending for Q and T is much higher than the maximum possible spending for P, R, and S (4.5 billion dollars), the country that spent the most on cell phones **must be either Q or T**.\n\nHowever, the exact values of $C_Q$ and $C_T$ are not determined. We only know they are both greater than 10 billion dollars. \n\n* **Case A:** $C_Q = 13$ billion and $C_T = 15$ billion. T spent the most.\n* **Case B:** $C_Q = 15$ billion and $C_T = 13$ billion. Q spent the most.\n\nSince we cannot definitively determine whether Q or T spent the most, the combined statements are not sufficient.\n\n**Statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are NOT SUFFICIENT.**\n\n---\n\nThe correct answer is E."

        "question":"A stretch of highway, Segment X, has no traffic signals and comprises three speed zones: One with a speed limit of 55 miles per hour (mph) followed by a 75-mph zone and a second 55-mph zone. Leslie is at a certain point on Segment X, driving at a speed she will exactly maintain until after she has reached the end of Segment X and has entered the next highway segment. Is she driving faster than 55 mph?",

        "solution":"Let $S$ be Leslie's constant speed. The goal is to determine if $S > 55$ mph.\nSegment X is composed of three zones in order: $Z_1$ (55 mph), $Z_2$ (75 mph), $Z_3$ (55 mph). Leslie maintains her current speed until the end of $Z_3$.\n\n### Analysis of Statement (1)\n(1) Leslie’s speed is at least 5 mph below the speed limit that currently applies to her.\n\nLet $L$ be the current speed limit. $S \\le L - 5$.\n\n* **Case A: Leslie is currently in a 55-mph zone ($Z_1$ or $Z_3$).** $L = 55$.\n    $$S \\le 55 - 5 \\implies S \\le 50 \\text{ mph}$$ \n    In this case, is $S > 55$? **NO.**\n\n* **Case B: Leslie is currently in the 75-mph zone ($Z_2$).** $L = 75$.\n    $$S \\le 75 - 5 \\implies S \\le 70 \\text{ mph}$$ \n    $S$ could be 65 mph. In this case, is $S > 55$? **YES.**\n\nSince the answer can be YES or NO, the statement is NOT sufficient.\n\n**Statement (1) ALONE is NOT sufficient.**\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Statement (2)\n(2) Leslie will reach the end of Segment X without ever exceeding any speed limits.\n\nLeslie's speed $S$ is constant. For her not to exceed any speed limits, $S$ must be less than or equal to the lowest speed limit of any zone she travels through from her current point to the end of Segment X ($Z_3$).\n\nRegardless of whether Leslie is currently in $Z_1$, $Z_2$, or $Z_3$, the path to the end of Segment X **must** include the final 55-mph zone ($Z_3$).\n\n* If Leslie is in $Z_1$, she passes through ${Z_1(55), Z_2(75), Z_3(55)}$. $S \\le 55$.\n* If Leslie is in $Z_2$, she passes through ${Z_2(75), Z_3(55)}$. $S \\le 55$.\n* If Leslie is in $Z_3$, she passes through ${Z_3(55)}$. $S \\le 55$.\n\nIf Leslie is in $Z_3$, she passes through ${Z_3(55)}$. $S \\le 55$.\n\nIn all cases, Leslie's speed $S$ must be $\\le 55$ mph. Therefore, the answer to the question 'Is she driving faster than 55 mph?' is definitively **NO**.\n\n**Statement (2) ALONE is SUFFICIENT.**\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nStatement (2) alone is sufficient to answer the question, but statement (1) alone is not sufficient.\n\nThe correct answer is B."
