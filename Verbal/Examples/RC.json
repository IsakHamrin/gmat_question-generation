      "question": "Recent studies in behavioral economics suggest that individuals often make financial decisions based not on objective outcomes but on how choices are framed. For example, people are more likely to invest in a fund described as '90% chance of gain' rather than one described as '10% chance of loss,' even when both provide identical expected returns.
