      "passage": "The development of early agricultural societies marked a profound shift in human history. Prior to widespread agriculture, humans lived as nomadic hunter-gatherers, constantly moving in search of food resources. The domestication of plants and animals, which began independently in several regions around 10,000 BCE, allowed for sedentary lifestyles. This surplus of food supported larger populations and led to the establishment of villages, towns, and eventually, cities. The specialization of labor also emerged, as not everyone needed to be involved in food production. Artisans, builders, and administrators could develop new skills and contribute to societal complexity. This transition laid the groundwork for the rise of civilizations, with their intricate social structures, monumental architecture, and organized governance.",

      "passage": "The concept of 'resilience' in ecological systems refers to their capacity to absorb disturbances and reorganize while undergoing change so as to retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks. A resilient ecosystem can withstand stress and bounce back after a perturbation, such as a fire, drought, or disease outbreak. For instance, a forest ecosystem that quickly regrows after a wildfire, maintaining its dominant tree species and overall biodiversity, demonstrates high resilience. Conversely, an ecosystem that transforms into a completely different type of biome, or loses significant species diversity, after a disturbance exhibits low resilience. Understanding resilience is crucial for conservation efforts, as it helps predict how ecosystems will respond to environmental changes, including those driven by climate change and human activities.",
