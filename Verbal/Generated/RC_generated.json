These vents spew superheated, mineral-rich water from the Earth's crust, providing the chemical energy that fuels chemosynthesis – the process by which microbes convert inorganic compounds into organic matter. This forms the base of a food web that includes unique species of tubeworms, mussels, and shrimp, many of which have evolved specialized adaptations to survive extreme pressures, temperatures, and toxic chemicals. The discovery of these vents has revolutionized our understanding of life's potential and the conditions under which it can arise and thrive, suggesting possibilities for extraterrestrial life.",

      "passage": "The concept of 'cognitive load' is central to understanding how individuals learn and process information. It refers to the total amount of mental effort being used in the working memory. When cognitive load exceeds an individual's capacity, learning becomes inefficient or even impossible. Educational designers often aim to manage this load by segmenting complex information, providing clear examples, and avoiding extraneous distractions. There are three types of cognitive load: intrinsic (inherent difficulty of the material), extraneous (imposed by the way information is presented), and germane (related to schema construction and processing). Optimizing learning involves reducing extraneous load and supporting germane load while acknowledging the intrinsic load.",
