      "question": "A recent study found that consumers who purchased organic produce reported feeling healthier and more energetic than those who bought conventionally grown produce. Researchers concluded that organic produce contributes to improved well-being. Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the researchers' conclusion?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The study participants were given detailed instructions on how to prepare their produce, regardless of whether it was organic or conventional.",
        "B": "Participants in the study were not informed whether they were receiving organic or conventional produce during the initial phase.",
        "C": "People who are already health-conscious are more likely to choose organic produce when given the option.",
        "D": "The study controlled for factors such as exercise levels, sleep habits, and overall diet.",
        "E": "Conventional produce is typically less expensive than organic produce."
      },
      "answer": "D",
      "solution": "Option D strengthens the argument by eliminating potential confounding variables. If the study controlled for other factors that influence health and energy, then the difference in reported well-being is more likely attributable to the organic produce itself, thus supporting the researchers' conclusion."

      "question": "The city's public library system implemented a new online reservation system for popular books to reduce wait times. Since the system's introduction, the average wait time for these books has decreased by 15%. Therefore, the new online reservation system has been effective in making popular books more accessible.",
      "options": {
        "A": "The library also increased its budget for acquiring new copies of popular books during the same period.",
        "B": "Many patrons still prefer to reserve books in person at the library circulation desk.",
        "C": "The previous reservation system allowed patrons to reserve books only by phone or in person.",
        "D": "The online system requires a library card and internet access, which some patrons may not have.",
        "E": "The decrease in wait times was most significant for books that were already less popular."
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "solution": "Option A weakens the conclusion by suggesting an alternative explanation for the reduced wait times. If the library simultaneously increased its collection of popular books, this action, rather than the online reservation system, could be the primary reason for shorter wait times."

      "question": "A recent survey indicated that companies with more flexible work-from-home policies tend to have higher employee retention rates. The survey's authors concluded that offering flexible work-from-home options is a key strategy for businesses looking to reduce employee turnover.",
      "options": {
        "A": "Employee retention rates are influenced by a variety of factors, including salary, benefits, and company culture.",
        "B": "The survey respondents included companies from various industries, making it difficult to generalize the findings.",
        "C": "Companies that can offer flexible work-from-home policies are likely already more successful and stable, possessing other desirable traits that encourage retention.",
        "D": "A significant number of employees who work from home report increased job satisfaction.",
        "E": "The survey did not account for the cost implications of implementing work-from-home policies."
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "solution": "Option C represents an unstated assumption. The argument assumes that the flexible work-from-home policy *causes* the higher retention. However, it's possible that companies which *already* have attributes that promote retention are the ones that are also able to offer such policies. Without this assumption, the causal link between flexible policies and retention is not guaranteed."

      "question": "The manufacturer of a new brand of energy drink claims that its product is superior because it contains a unique blend of natural electrolytes and vitamins, which are essential for muscle recovery after exercise. The drink is also marketed as having a refreshing taste and being low in sugar. Consumer reviews, however, indicate that while the taste is generally praised, a significant portion of users do not feel any noticeable improvement in their post-exercise recovery compared to other sports drinks they have used.",
      "options": {
        "A": "The energy drink is likely to be widely adopted by professional athletes.",
        "B": "The unique blend of electrolytes and vitamins may not significantly impact muscle recovery for the average consumer.",
        "C": "The low sugar content is the primary reason for the positive consumer reviews.",
        "D": "Consumers are generally skeptical of claims made by energy drink manufacturers.",
        "E": "The company will likely discontinue the product due to poor sales."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "solution": "Option B is the most logical inference. The argument states that consumers praised the taste but did not notice improved recovery, despite the manufacturer's claims about its unique blend. This suggests that the claimed benefits for muscle recovery might not be as effective or noticeable as advertised for the general consumer."

      "question": "A company that manufactures high-end kitchen appliances introduced a new line of smart refrigerators equipped with touchscreens and internet connectivity. Initially, sales figures for the new refrigerators were lower than projected. The company's marketing director argued that this was due to the high initial price point, which is common for innovative technology, and that sales would increase as the technology became more mainstream and prices decreased.",
      "options": {
        "A": "The number of competing brands offering similar smart refrigerator features.",
        "B": "The average income level of the target demographic for high-end kitchen appliances.",
        "C": "The comparative cost of the smart refrigerators versus the company's previous, non-smart models.",
        "D": "The sales figures of the company's other appliance lines introduced at similar price points and with new technology.",
        "E": "Consumer awareness and understanding of the benefits offered by the smart features of the refrigerators."
      },
      "answer": "D",
      "solution": "Option D is crucial for evaluating the marketing director's argument. If other new, innovative products from the same company at similar price points experienced similar initial low sales but later succeeded, it would support the director's claim that the initial price is the main obstacle and that sales will eventually rise. Without this comparative data, it's difficult to determine if the low sales are indeed due to the price point or other factors."

      "question": "The local bakery has been experiencing a decline in sales over the past year. To combat this, they decided to offer a free pastry with every purchase of a dozen pastries. After implementing this promotion, sales of individual pastries actually decreased further, leading the bakery owner to conclude that offering discounts is detrimental to their business.",
      "options": {
        "A": "The owner assumes that the free pastry promotion was the only change implemented by the bakery.",
        "B": "The owner draws a conclusion about all discounts based on the failure of one specific promotional strategy.",
        "C": "The owner fails to consider that some customers might be hoarding pastries.",
        "D": "The owner incorrectly assumes that customers prefer free pastries over discounted prices.",
        "E": "The owner mistakes a correlation between the promotion and the sales decline for causation."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "solution": "Option B identifies the flaw. The owner experienced a failure with one particular type of promotion (a 'buy X, get one free' deal) and then concluded that *all* discounts are detrimental. This is a faulty generalization; other types of discounts or different promotional strategies might be effective."
