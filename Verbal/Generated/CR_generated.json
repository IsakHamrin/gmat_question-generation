      "question": "A recent study found a strong correlation between increased ice cream consumption and higher rates of drowning. Researchers have concluded that eating ice cream causes people to be more susceptible to drowning. \n\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the researchers' conclusion?",
      "options": {
        "A": "During the summer months, both ice cream consumption and swimming activities increase significantly.",
        "B": "Drowning can occur in various bodies of water, including pools, lakes, and oceans.",
        "C": "The study tracked ice cream consumption and drowning incidents over a period of five years.",
        "D": "Many people who consume ice cream do not engage in swimming or water-related activities.",
        "E": "The researchers controlled for factors such as age and geographic location in their analysis."
      },
      "answer": "A",
      "solution": "The conclusion is that ice cream consumption causes drowning. Option A suggests a third factor, summer weather, that could independently cause both increased ice cream consumption and increased swimming (and thus, potentially, drowning). This alternative explanation weakens the causal link between ice cream and drowning."

      "question": "All mammals are warm-blooded. Whales are mammals. Therefore, whales are warm-blooded. \n\nWhich of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Some warm-blooded animals are not mammals.",
        "B": "Whales live in the ocean.",
        "C": "The premises of the argument are true.",
        "D": "If something is a mammal, it must be warm-blooded.",
        "E": "All warm-blooded animals can survive in cold climates."
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "solution": "This is a deductive argument. If the premises are true (that all mammals are warm-blooded and whales are mammals), the conclusion (whales are warm-blooded) logically and necessarily follows. Strengthening the argument means confirming the truth of its premises."

      "question": "The new environmental regulation requires all factories to install advanced air filtration systems, which are very expensive. Factory owners argue that this regulation will lead to significant job losses as companies cut costs to afford the new systems. \n\nWhich of the following is an unstated assumption made by the factory owners?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The environmental regulation will be enforced strictly.",
        "B": "The advanced air filtration systems will effectively reduce air pollution.",
        "C": "Companies will not be able to absorb the cost of the filtration systems without reducing their workforce.",
        "D": "New jobs will be created in the manufacturing of air filtration systems.",
        "E": "The government will provide subsidies to help factories afford the new systems."
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "solution": "The factory owners' argument is that the cost of filtration systems will lead to job losses. This relies on the assumption that companies cannot afford both the filtration systems and maintain their current workforce levels. Option C directly states this necessary link."

      "question": "In the city of Veridia, bicycles are the primary mode of transportation for a significant portion of the population. However, the number of reported bicycle thefts has been steadily increasing over the past two years. City officials are considering implementing a mandatory bicycle registration program, believing it will deter thieves. \n\nWhich of the following can be most logically inferred from the information provided?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The mandatory bicycle registration program will successfully reduce bicycle thefts.",
        "B": "Veridia has a higher rate of bicycle ownership than other comparable cities.",
        "C": "Many of the stolen bicycles in Veridia are unregistered.",
        "D": "The increasing number of bicycle thefts is a significant problem for the city's residents.",
        "E": "Bicycle owners in Veridia are unlikely to report all bicycle thefts."
      },
      "answer": "D",
      "solution": "The passage states that bicycle thefts have been steadily increasing and that city officials are concerned enough to consider a new program. This implies that the increase in thefts is viewed as a problem that needs addressing, making option D the most logical inference."

      "question": "A pharmaceutical company is developing a new drug designed to improve memory recall in elderly patients. Pre-clinical trials on animals showed promising results, with significant improvements in maze navigation and object recognition tasks. The company plans to proceed with human trials, expecting similar positive outcomes. \n\nWhich of the following questions is most important to answer in order to evaluate the company's expectations?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Will the new drug have any side effects on elderly patients?",
        "B": "Are the animal models used in pre-clinical trials similar to human cognitive processes?",
        "C": "What is the current market demand for drugs that improve memory recall?",
        "D": "How many different types of memory recall tasks were used in the animal trials?",
        "E": "Will the human trials be conducted in multiple research facilities?"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "solution": "The company's expectation is based on animal trial results. To evaluate this expectation, it's crucial to know if the results from animal trials are transferable to humans. Option B directly addresses the validity of using animal models for predicting human cognitive response, making it the most important question for evaluation."

      "question": "The marketing team launched a new advertising campaign for their energy drink, featuring popular athletes. In the quarter following the campaign's launch, sales of the energy drink increased by 15%. The company's president concluded that the advertising campaign was directly responsible for the sales increase. \n\nWhich of the following is most similar to the flaw in the president's reasoning?",
      "options": {
        "A": "A person starts a new diet and begins exercising regularly. They lose weight. They conclude that the diet caused the weight loss, ignoring the exercise.",
        "B": "A scientist observes that crops grow taller in soil treated with a certain fertilizer. They conclude that the fertilizer is the sole cause of increased growth, without considering other factors like sunlight and water.",
        "C": "A student studies diligently for a test and receives a high score. They conclude that studying harder leads to better grades.",
        "D": "A company implements a new customer service policy. Customer satisfaction ratings increase. They conclude that the new policy caused the increase in satisfaction.",
        "E": "A city experiences a heatwave, and ice cream sales surge. The ice cream vendor concludes that the heatwave caused the increase in sales."
      },
      "answer": "E",
      "solution": "The president's reasoning is flawed because it assumes that because event B (sales increase) happened after event A (ad campaign launch), A must have caused B. This is a classic post hoc ergo propter hoc (after this, therefore because of this) fallacy. Option E presents the same logical flaw: assuming causation based solely on temporal sequence and a plausible but unproven link, ignoring other potential contributing factors (like seasonality, or other marketing efforts)."
