        "solution1":" The most straightforward way to calculate the arithmetic mean of the masses ofT. rex for the 19 integer values of its age from 12–30 is to read the values of the mass corresponding to each of these ages from the graph, add them together, and divide the result by 19. But since each option in the menu is a 1,000-year range, a rough approximation should be sufficient for this problem. Since the graph is approximately linear from age 12 to age 20, the value of the mass corresponding to the midpoint of that interval (i.e., 3,000, the vertical coordinate of point B) serves as a good approximation of the arithmetic mean for the 9 corresponding integer values of the age. From age 21 to age 30, the range of the mass is quite narrow (approximately 5,400–5,600). Using 5,500 to approximate the mass from age 21 to age 30 leads to the following estimate for the arithmetic mean: ​1/19((9*3000 )+10(5500)) = 1/19*82,000 = 4315(15/19​) This value falls between 4,000 and 5,000. The correct answer is 4,000 and 5,000.",
        "solution2":"The analysis compares the masses at **age 12 (900)**, **age 16 (3,000)**, and **age 20 (5,100)**. The **numerical mass change** is constant over both 4-year periods (2,100). The **percent change in mass** from age 12 to 16 is calculated as $$\\frac{3000-900}{900} \\approx 233\\% $$. The percent change from age 16 to 20 is calculated as $$\\frac{5100-3000}{3000} = 70\\% $$. The ratio of the first percent change to the second is $$\\frac{233\\%}{70\\%} \\approx 3.33$$. Therefore, the percent change in mass from age 12 to age 16 is roughly **3 times** the corresponding percent change from age 16 to age 20."
