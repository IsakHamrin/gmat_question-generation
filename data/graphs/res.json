    "explanation1": "Observe the rightmost point on the graph. The x-coordinate of this point represents the time at which the temperature is highest. This occurs at approximately t=22.4.",
    "explanation2": "Locate t=8.0 on the x-axis. Move vertically up to the graph line and then horizontally to the y-axis to read the corresponding temperature. This value is approximately 10401.",
